Notes
  =>User data is saved in users.txt in a basic format (username,email,hashed-password). This is for learning purposes only and not secure for production.

  =>The cart is stored in localStorage, meaning it's client-side only and resets per browser/device.

  =>PHP must be enabled for the backend registration and login functionality to work.
